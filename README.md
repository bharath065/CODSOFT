All these 3 codes were done by using python language in visual studio code.

You need to enter 2 numbers inorder for the furthur process
then i had given options for each operation using if-elif statements
enetr those respective options to perform that specific operations.

Enter rock,paper or scissors
the computer will chose it's own choice using random module
then it will check both choices and gives the winner as output.

3.password generator
Enter your desired password length inorder to get the password generated
